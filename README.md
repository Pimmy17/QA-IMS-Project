# QA IMS Project
This project is an Inventory Management System that allows the creation, deletion and updating of customers, items and customer's orders.

## Getting Started

To get this project working on your own system follow the below instructions:

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
*Terminal:*
Powershell - Is already installed in most Computers
Git & GitBash - Installation can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

*IDE:*
[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) - Recommended
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Will require additional add-ons installing within the IDE in order to run Java files properly

*Cloning the Repo:*
If you have access to a terminal and an IDE then you should be able to clone the repo to allow you to run the application or if you fork and clone the repo, then you can make your own changes and version of the IMS.

    Firstly, head to my main page of the repo by [clicking here](https://github.com/Pimmy17/QA-IMS-Project).
    
    Secondly, click the green 'Code' button, which will present a drop down with the HTTPS and SSH key need to clone the repo.
    
    Thirdly, head to your terminal and the folder you wish to copy this repo in to and then type in 'git clone' followed by either the HTTPS or SSH key.
    Then press enter to begin the cloning
    Below is what your terminal will look like if you used the SSH key.
    
    Finally, to access the repo do the following depending on which of the above IDEs you decided on:
    For Eclipse: Open up the project by selecting -> 'File' ---> 'Open Projects From File System' ---> Select 'Directory' and choose the file where the IMS project is      stored on your system.
    For VS Code: Whilst in your terminal, type in 'cd QA-IMS-Project' to enter the project file, then type 'code .'
    This should open up VS Code and the project.
```

### Installing
